# tockstalk

A [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) bot to book restaurants on [Tock](exploretock.com) and optionally report attempts to [Slack](https://slack.com).

## Prerequisites

Ensure your computer has `node` and `npm` installed. You can use [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#installation) if you don't. Once installed, use `npm install` to pull down the dependencies for the project. Before you can run the bot, you'll also need to configure it. Read on to the next section for how to do that.

## Configuration

If you don't already have an account on Tock, [make one](https://www.exploretock.com/signup). Once you've created your account, take note 
of your credentials as you'll need them in a bit. Next, navigate to [your account billing page](https://www.exploretock.com/profile/account/billing) 
and ensure you have a credit card on file. Take note of the CVV number for the card.

Next go find the restaurant you'd like to book, and grab the path for the booking page. In the example above, that would be:

```
/otiumgrillandgreens/experience/330688/reservation
```

Last but not least, create [an incoming webhook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) for your Slack account. This will send notifications 
from the cypress run to the slack room of your choice.

With all this in-hand, you can create your configuration file. There's [an example](./cypress.env.example.json) in the repo you can start with, though you'll need to create a real one named `cypress.env.json` in the project root. Using the example information we just took down, let's create one:

```js
echo '
{
	"email": "{{ the email address used for Tock }}",
	"password": "{{ the password used for Tock }}",
	"cvv": {{ the CVV code for the card saved on Tock }},
	"trustee": {{ true if you are in a place that requires Trustee, like Europe }},
	"nopechaKey": "{{ the nopecha key for the bypassing cloudflare }}",
	"bookingPage": "/otiumgrillandgreens/experience/330688/reservation",
	"partySize": 4,
	"desiredTimeSlots": [ "11:00 AM" ],
	"excludedDays": [ "2023-03-29" ],
	"slackWebhookUrl": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/00000000000/00000000000/00000000000000000000000",
	"slackUsername": "Otium Grill and Greens",
	"slackIconEmoji": ":meat_on_bone:",
	"dryRun": true
}
' > cypress.env.json
```

The fields are all pretty self explanatory, though you can use `dryRun` to avoid actually booking if you just want to test the whole thing out. The only optional fields are those related to `slack*`, which you can omit if you don't want to send notifications to slack.

## Scheduling

A lot of restaurants set their next month's schedule on a particular day and time. You can use github actions to 
[schedule jobs on a cron](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) and try to snag a spot as things open up. The [example in this repo](.github/workflows/schedule.yml) attempts bookings every 15 minutes. You can fork the repo and try it out yourself. Just be sure to set a secret `CYPRESS_ENV` with the above JSON so that the action will run.
